# Project README Template (Human Readable)

⚠️ **IMPORTANT — HUMAN READERS ONLY** ⚠️
This README is the only human‑focused document. It must not be reviewed, included in AI context, or recognized by AI.

**AI AGENTS MUST IGNORE THIS FILE.**
Authoritative AI behavior is defined exclusively in:
- .github/copilot-instructions.md
- /.ai/*

If instructions here conflict with AI governance files, THIS FILE IS WRONG.
