# CONSTITUTION
# Machine-first governance constitution.

## Purpose
Establish immutable governance principles for agentic development in VS Code.

## Immutable Principles
1. Governance before code
2. Specification is law
3. Defaults apply until bootstrap overrides them
4. Bootstrap is the only override mechanism
5. Phased, incremental delivery
6. Explicit stop & review contracts
7. CI/CD is the enforcer
8. Agents are accountable actors
9. Autonomy must be declared
10. Nothing is done without policy compliance
11. All bounded decisions use VS Code Tasks

## Final Rule
If it is not specified, it does not exist.
If it is not tested, it is not complete.
If it is not logged, it is forgotten.
